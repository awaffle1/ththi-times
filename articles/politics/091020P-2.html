  <h2>LIRANAHOLM-ATOMICH SCHISM WAR CONTINUES</h2>
  By Nonadia
  
Recently, Liranaholm (Dwarf Land4) invaded Hymn Island with little resistance due to the only military presence on the island being the Prison Fort. The 5,000 soldiers in the Prison Fort fought back and got into defensive positions on cliff beaches near the Liranan landing site where they will invade Hymn Island. The soldiers fired Schismian Laser Rifles, but they surrendered due to being outnumbered, knowing they had no chance of winning. The Atomic Schism destroyed the province of Forwest to deter Liranaholm, and evacuted it. Millions couldn't leave or just didn't want to, leaving many unemployed, and

Fiercewood offered aid in the refugee crisis in the Atomic Schism, but surprisingly, they refused the aid stating that "the 'refugees' you speak of are nothing more than savage criminals serving their purgatorial sentence in the natural state of their birthland. God will not permit the interference of the sentencing, thus neither shall the Dual Church."
