  <h2>NONADIAN-LUWUIAN WAR AT A STANDSTILL</h2>
  By Nonadia
  
The Luwuian rebels, the Luwuian Prosperity Coalition, have taken over foreign relations after taking over 50% of Luwuian land. And after they took over, they requested peace with Nonadia. The Nonadian government gave them the Treaty of Swanie, which the LPC refused stating it interfered with their goals and ambitions, and so they brought the Treaty of Hudson City, which Nonadia refused stating that the Treaty of Swanie would be beneficial to Luwuia. After both nations requested peace talks be held in Kavastor, Kavastor agreed, and brought another treaty.

<h3>Kavastor Treaty</h3>
- A total of 1 trillion in Luwuian dollars will be paid by each side
- Both nations will avoid war for at least 5 years (5 weeks irl)
- A Kavadstori peace keeping force will occupy a 30 mile neutral zone that no Luwuian or Nonadian forces can cross
- A military defeat will not be acknowledged by either side as Nonadia did mange to strike back, but Luwuia did mange to inflict damage at an extreme level
- All military assets regarding a destructive capacity great enough to sink a destroyer/level a large building must be logged and placed under Kavastori supervision
- all persons visiting Kavastor must quarantine for 14 days

Nonadia refused due to Section 5 stating Kavastor would log and survey any military assets available to destroy a large building or destroyer. More updates will come once Luwuia responds.
